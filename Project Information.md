# Retail Promotions Analysis: Courts vs Harvey Norman

## Introduction
This project focuses on web scraping product data from two of Singapore's most popular electronics and home appliance retailers: **Courts** and **Harvey Norman**. 

With the upcoming Hari Raya celebrations in 2025, both retailers have launched special promotional campaigns offering significant discounts across various product categories.

Link to the retailers promo page during HariRaya 2025: 
* Courts: <https://www.courts.com.sg/clearance?product_list_limit=40>
* Harvey Norman: <https://www.harveynorman.com.sg/promotions-en/harvey-raya-sale-2025-en/page-1/?items_per_page=40>
  
**Objective:** The primary objectives of this web scraping project are to:
* Extract comprehensive product information from both Courts and Harvey Norman websites
* Identify the top discounted products from each retailer's Hari Raya promotions
* Compare identical or similar products across both retailers to find the most affordable options
* Analyze pricing trends and discount patterns to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions

By systematically collecting and analyzing this data, the project aims to provide valuable insights for consumers looking to maximize savings during the Hari Raya promotional period, while also demonstrating effective web scraping techniques for retail price comparison.

## Methodology
The methodology focused on efficiently gathering comprehensive product information while respecting website structures and ethical scraping practices.

### Technology Stack
I used the following technologies for web scraping:
   * **Python 3.7+:** Core programming language for the project
   * **Beautiful Soup 4:** HTML parsing library to navigate and extract data from web page structures
   * **Requests:** HTTP library to fetch web pages and handle sessions
   * **Pandas:** Data manipulation library for organizing and analyzing the extracted data
   * **Regular expressions (re):** Pattern matching for extracting specific data formats and cleaning text

### Scraping Approach
### 1. Initial Research and Website Analysis
Before writing any code, I conducted a thorough analysis of both websites:
* Manually navigated through the Hari Raya promotional pages on both Courts and Harvey Norman
* Identified common product information patterns and data structures
* Examined the HTML structure and JavaScript data layers using browser developer tools
* Checked for any rate limiting, anti-scraping measures, or robots.txt restrictions
* Documented the URL patterns for promotional pages and pagination systems

### 2. Courts Website Scraping Strategy
For the Courts website:
* **Entry Point Identification:** Located the main Hari Raya promotion landing page and mapped the category structure
* **Pagination Handling:** Implemented logic to navigate through multiple pages of product listings
* **Session Management:** Maintained consistent session cookies to simulate normal browsing behavior

### 3. Harvey Norman Website Scraping Strategy
For the Harvey Norman website:
* **Promotion Page Navigation:** Located and mapped the Hari Raya promotional sections
* **JavaScript Data Extraction:**
  * Identified script tags containing product arrays with item details
  * Used regular expressions to extract and convert JavaScript objects to valid JSON
  * Parsed structured data to extract comprehensive product information
* **HTML Parsing Fallback:** Implemented secondary extraction logic using BeautifulSoup to parse product elements directly from the DOM
    
### 4. Parallel Processing
To improve efficiency while maintaining ethical scraping practices:
  * Implemented throttled parallel processing for handling multiple pages
  * Used thread pools with controlled concurrency (max 3-5 concurrent requests)
  * Maintained sufficient delays between requests to the same domain
  * Implemented exponential backoff for retry attempts

## Data Extraction
* Initial Page Access: Started with the main Hari Raya promotional landing page to access all featured products.
* Pagination Handling: Implemented logic to navigate through multiple pages of results within the promotions section to capture all available products.

### Data Extraction Workflow
The general extraction workflow for both websites followed these steps:
  * Send HTTP requests with appropriate headers (User-Agent, Accept, etc.) to avoid blocking
  * Handle response status codes and implement retry logic for failed requests
  * Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
  * Extract product data using dual approaches:
    * Search for JavaScript data structures containing structured product information
    * Parse HTML elements containing product details as fallback
  * Extract key product attributes:
    * Product name
    * Price (original and discounted)
    * Discount percentage/amount
  * Store extracted data in csv files
  * Implement appropriate delays between requests to respect server resources

#### Harvey Norman Data Extraction
The Harvey Norman website required a different approach due to its unique structure:
* JavaScript Data Targeting: Identified that product information was primarily stored in JavaScript variables within the page source. For example:

    var items = [{ 'item_id': '85044', 'item_name': 'Samsung 530L 2 Door Fridge - Refined Inox (RT53DG7A6CS9SS)', 'item_brand': 'S', "item_category" : 'Fridges', ...}];

* Regular Expression Extraction: Used regex patterns to locate and extract these JavaScript data structures that contained rich product information.
* HTML Fallback Method: In cases where JavaScript data wasn't available, implemented a secondary extraction method that directly parsed the HTML elements containing product information.

**Handling Website Variations** 
Both websites presented unique challenges that required adaptive extraction techniques:
   * Dynamic Content: Some promotional sections loaded products dynamically with JavaScript, requiring session management and request headers that mimicked browser behavior.
   * Inconsistent Data Structures: Product information wasn't always presented in a consistent format, requiring flexible parsing logic.
   * Rate Limiting Consideration: Implemented appropriate delays between requests to respect server resources and avoid IP blocking.

### Data Cleaning
After extraction, the raw data required several cleaning steps to make it suitable for analysis and comparison:
* Brand Extraction
The combined product information often included brand names embedded within the full product name:
Brand Identification: Extracted brand names from the beginning of product names where they typically appeared (e.g., "Samsung 530L 2 Door Fridge" â†’ brand: "Samsung"). A new column as brand was added to the csv file. 

* Price Cleaning
   * Currency Symbol Removal: Removed the "$" sign from all price values to convert them to numeric format.
   * String to Numeric Conversion: Transformed price strings into float values for mathematical operations.
   * Missing Price Handling: Replaced NaN values to zeros.

* Product Type & Category Classification
   * Product categorization was derived from analyzing the full product names:
   * Keyword Extraction: Identified key product type indicators in names (e.g., "Fridge", "TV", "Washing Machine").
   * Hierarchical Categorization: Created a category hierarchy by grouping products into major categories (e.g., "Kitchen Appliances", "Home Entertainment").
   * Category Standardization: Normalized category names across retailers to enable direct comparison of similar product types.

* Discount Calculation
    Created additional data points to facilitate deal comparison:
     * Percentage Discount: Calculated discount percentage using the formula:
          discount_percentage = ((original_price - current_price) / original_price) * 100
     * Absolute Discount Amount: Calculated the actual dollar savings:
          discount_amount = original_price - current_price

* Data Structuring
   The final cleaned data was structured into a comprehensive CSV file with the following columns:
     * retailer: Source retailer (Courts or Harvey Norman)
     * product_name: Full product name as displayed on the website
     * brand: Extracted and normalized brand name
     * product_type: Primary product type (e.g., TV, Refrigerator)
     * category: Broader product category (e.g., Electronics, Home Appliances)
     * original_price: Original price before discount
     * current_price: Current promotional price
     * discount_amount: Dollar amount saved
     * discount_percentage: Percentage discount offered
     * url: Direct link to the product page

This structured dataset provided the foundation for subsequent analysis to identify the best deals across both retailers during the Hari Raya promotional period.
