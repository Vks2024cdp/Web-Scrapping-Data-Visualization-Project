## Introduction
This project focuses on web scraping product data from two of Singapore's most popular electronics and home appliance retailers: **Courts** and **Harvey Norman**. 

With the upcoming Hari Raya celebrations in 2025, both retailers have launched special promotional campaigns offering significant discounts across various product categories.
